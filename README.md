# HealthyLife

### Azure Path
[HealthyLife](https://healthylifewebmvc.azurewebsites.net)

### Goals
The main goal of this project was to get users to feel happier and healthier, by keeping track of their most important habits relating to health/happiness. Sleep, exercise, and diet directly correlate to how happy someone feels, as well as how healthy they are. I wanted to get the users to interact as much as possible with their own habits, by keeping track of what makes them tick.

### Functionality
-User creates a person profile, that will keep track of the other data as they input.
-User will input their sleep/exercise/diet/happiness data daily and have the ability to perform all CRUD options on these data sets.

### Version 2.0
-more connectivity between the happy and bad days, and the data that correlates. I want to show the user what their habits were like on good vs. bad days.
-better viewining experience
-date views for better data organization
